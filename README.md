# HotDogOrNot Classification with CNN
This project is focused on designing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of hotdogs. The dataset consists of images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, which requires pre-processing for uniform input to the network. This repository contains some python files that walk you through the entire process: data loading, image pre-processing, model training, performance evaluation and plots creation.
